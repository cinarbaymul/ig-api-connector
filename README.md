# ig-api-connector

This repo aims to build a python package to facilitate connection to the IG trading platform. You need to have an account set up on the platform in order to be able to use the script.

**Disclaimer**: Test everything on a demo account before switching to a live connection.

You can initiate a connection by passing the following arguments:

ig_connect( account_type = ['live', 'demo'], key = string, user_id = string, password = string)
